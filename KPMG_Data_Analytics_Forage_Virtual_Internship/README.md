# KPMG Data Analytics Virtual Internship

The [KPMG Data Analytics Virtual Internship](https://www.theforage.com/virtual-internships/theme/m7W4GMqeT3bh9Nb2c/KPMG-Data-Analytics-Virtual-Internship?ref=7m99dkPfXTbA3Y2Fb) is designed to help us gain a practical insight into the work done at KPMG.

## Introduction

Sprocket Central Pty Ltd, a medium size bikes & cycling accessories organisation, has approached Tony Smith (Partner) in KPMG’s Lighthouse & Innovation Team. Sprocket Central Pty Ltd  is keen to learn more about KPMG’s expertise in its Analytics, Information & Modeling team. The project is divided into three tasks:

## Task 1: Data Quality Assessment
#### Assessment of data quality and completeness in preparation for analysis

The client provided KPMG with 3 datasets:

* Customer Demographic 
* Customer Addresses
* Transactions data in the past 3 months

We performed preliminary data exploration and identified ways to improve the quality of Sprocket Central Pty Ltd’s data. Furthermore, we drafted an email to the client identifying the data quality issues and strategies to mitigate these issues.

## Task 2: Data Insights
#### Targeting high value customers based on customer demographics and attributes.

Sprocket Central Pty Ltd has given us a new list of 1000 potential customers with their demographics and attributes. However, these customers do not have prior transaction history with the organisation. 

The marketing team at Sprocket Central Pty Ltd is sure that, if correctly analysed, the data would reveal useful customer insights which could help optimise resource allocation for targeted marketing. Hence, improve performance by focusing on high value customers.

* In building this recommendation, we started with a PowerPoint presentation which outlined the approach which we will be taking. 
* The client has agreed on a 3 week scope with the following 3 phases as follows - Data Exploration, Model Development and Interpretation.
* Prepared a detailed approach for completing the analysis including activities – i.e. understanding the data distributions, feature engineering, data transformations, modelling, results interpretation and reporting.

## Task 3: Data Insights and Presentation
#### Using visualisations to present insights

Developed a dashboard using Tableau that displays the data summary and results of the analysis. Some of the focussed business context when presenting findings were: 
* What are the trends in the underlying data?
* Which customer segment has the highest customer value?
* What do you propose should be Sprocket Central Pty Ltd ’s marketing and growth strategy?
* What additional external datasets may be useful to obtain greater insights into customer preferences and propensity to purchase the products?
