This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python and SAS on the happiness rate of countries based on attributes such as happiness score, social support, GDP per capita, family, life expectancy, perceptions of corruption, etc. and analyzes the effect of COVID-19 on the individual attributes as well as the overall happiness of countries. Additionally, the project also compares Canada to the happiest country in the world, Finland, to identify any areas of improvement for Canada.
