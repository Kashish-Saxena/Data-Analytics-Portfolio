# Data Analytics Portfolio
Hello! 

Welcome to my Data Science and Analytics Portfolio. I am a fast and enthusiastic learner who enjoys analyzing datasets and extracting and visualizing relevant insights to answer business-related questions and make data-driven decisions. My portfolio includes guided projects I completed on coursera as well as my own personal projects.

For any further questions or if you generally want to connect, feel free to email me at s.kashish0123@gmail.com or connect with me on LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/kashishsaxena/)
