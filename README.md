# Data Analytics Portfolio
Hello! 

Welcome to my Data Science and Analytics Portfolio.

I am a software engineering graduate from Carleton University, Canada and a Data Analytics graduate student at George Brown College. My undergraduate education has given me various opportunities to explore my skills and interests and has influenced my decision to build a career in the field of Data Science & Analytics. I have a strong academic background in mathematics, statistics and computer programming. Throughout my undergraduate degree, I had taken several courses in mathematics, statistics, programming as well as data science courses, which led me to develop a deep interest in pursuing a career in data analytics and gave me the fundamental knowledge required in this field.

I am a fast learner and self-starter who enjoys analyzing datasets and extracting and visualizing relevant insights to answer business-related questions and make data-driven decisions. My portfolio includes guided projects I completed on coursera as well as my own personal projects.I have been constantly honing my skills in data analysis through personal projects and volunteering. Recently, I volunteered at an early-stage startup as a marketing and analytics team lead, where I experienced how a data-driven approach can lead to increased efficiency and positive results. This made me realize how important and powerful data is in making decisions in an organization and motivated me to become a Data Analyst.
